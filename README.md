# Overview

This project is a simple To-Do List Manager application developed in C++ to deepen my understanding of core programming concepts such as variables, conditionals, loops, functions, classes, and the Standard Template Library (STL). The software allows users to add, view, mark tasks as completed, and exit the application via a command-line interface.

The purpose of writing this software is to practice and demonstrate fundamental C++ programming skills while building a useful utility that could be expanded in the future.

# Development Environment

The software was developed using Visual Studio Code as the text editor, and the GNU GCC compiler for compiling and running the C++ code. The C++17 standard was used, and the STL's `vector` container was utilized for managing the list of tasks.

# Future Work

- Add persistent file storage to save and load tasks between sessions.
- Implement task editing and deletion capabilities.
- Improve user interface with input validation and clearer prompts.
- Add due dates and priorities for tasks.
- Explore implementing a graphical user interface (GUI).
